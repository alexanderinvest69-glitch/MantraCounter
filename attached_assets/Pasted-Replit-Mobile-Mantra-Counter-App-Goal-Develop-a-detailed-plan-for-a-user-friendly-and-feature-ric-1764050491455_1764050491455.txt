Replit Mobile Mantra Counter App
Goal:
Develop a detailed plan for a user-friendly and feature-rich mobile mantra counter application, optimized for implementation on the Replit platform by a prompt engineer and mobile app developer.

Requirements
The app must function as a dedicated mantra counter.

Upon reaching a count of 108, the device must vibrate clearly.

Counting actions should support both screen touch and volume up/down buttons for increasing and decreasing the count respectively.

The application must allow users to create and manage up to 10 distinct counter configurations.

The user interface and experience should prioritize simplicity, intuitiveness, and ease of use, even with advanced features.

Ideas should consider the technical feasibility and development environment of the Replit platform for mobile app creation.

The proposed features should enhance the user's meditation or counting practice, not complicate it.

Ideas must be presented in a way that is immediately actionable for an 'ultra pro' prompt engineer.

Consider how the app handles edge cases, such as accidental button presses or resetting counts.
